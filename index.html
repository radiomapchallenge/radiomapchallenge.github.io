												<p>SIn wireless communications, the pathloss (or large scale fading coefficient) quantifies the loss
of signal strength between a transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx) due to large scale effects, such as
free-space propagation loss, and interactions of the radio waves with the obstacles (which block
line-of-sight, like buildings, vehicles, pedestrians), e.g. penetrations, reflections and diffractions.
Many present or envisioned applications in wireless communications explicitly rely on the
knowledge of the pathloss function, and thus, estimating pathloss is a crucial task. Some
example use cases include: User-cell site association, fingerprint-based localization, physical-
layer security, optimal power control, path planning, and activity detection.
Deterministic simulation methods such as ray-tracing are well-known to provide very good
estimations of pathloss values. However, their high computational complexity renders them
unsuitable for most of the envisioned applications.
In the very recent years, many research groups have developed deep learning-based methods
which achieve a comparable accuracy with respect to ray-tracing, but with orders of magnitude
lower computational times, making accurate pathloss estimations available for the applications.
In order to foster research and facilitate fair comparisons among the methods, we provide a
novel pathloss radio map dataset based on ray-tracing simulations and launch the First Pathloss
Radio Map Prediction Challenge.
In addition to the pathloss prediction task, the challenge also includes coverage classification
as a second independent task, where the locations in a city map should be classified to be above
or below a given pathloss value.
Support on the dataset and the instructions will be provided by the organizing team.</p>

											<p>The first task is to predict the pathloss radio map given the city map and the transmitter
location.
                                            </p>
                                            <h3>Task #2: Coverage classification</h3>
											<p>In coverage (or service area) classification, the goal is to classify a region of interest according
to their pathloss values being above or below some pre-determined pathloss value, given a Tx
with known location and the city map. The goal is then to predict the coverage map from the city map and transmitter location.
